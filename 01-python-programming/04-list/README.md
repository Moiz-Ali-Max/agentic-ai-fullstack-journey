## List:-
List is a mutuable datatype which means it is modifiable or editable. Store multiple values in one variables. And also that value could be of any type.
How to know which variables is list:
- First the variables should be plural (like names).
### Prose and Cons of List:
Pros:
- It is a dynamic length
- Multiple datatypes we assigned in list.
- Indexing
1. Positive Indexing range 0 to n-1
2. Negative Indexing ranges -1 to lenght

- In list we do indexing from both sides. left to right and right to left.

### Slicing:
When we want to extract two or more items at a time then we use slicing. When we do slicing, we call variable name, start, end and then step.
- By-Default slicing is always goes from left-to-right except when we do negatives. And the data we get always in a list.
- start: It is int and included
- end: it is int and it is excluded means n-1
- step: it is int and it is sequence
