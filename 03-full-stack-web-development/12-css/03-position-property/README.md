1. Display Property:-
``` The Display property specifies the display behavior of an element. ```

- Block elements are always display in next line
- Let' say we have two div tags, then the content of both tags are display next line. b/c they takes full width.
- It respect custom width and height.
- It also respect margin and padding. 
- So we convert block into inline using display = inline

### Inline Element:
- Tags like, (a, span)
- It takes the width where content actual ends.
- width = content width
- It cannot apply custom width and height.
- Also cannot apply custom margin. Only applies padding.
- So we convert inline block to block using display = block.

- display = inline-block
